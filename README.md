The Final_Code_run_(5)_(3)_(4).ipynb  has the final code for Preprocessing and Transformers, however changed were made to the CNN BILSTM code which are reflected in CNN.ipynb ,
CNN.ipynb has the same preprocessing code as final code but different and final CNN-Bilstm code, Plots.ipynb has the plots.

All the training and teesting logs are mentioned in the code file
